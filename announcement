Good evening,

Murble and I are announcing a proposal for the 2014 LBW!

We are proposing to hold the LBW in the Principality of Wales.  A Principality which we have yet to visit.  In ancient times, the Romans struggled to conquer the area, held back by the mountainous terrain.  These days the occupying Prince rarely fights the natives, preferring to concentrate on an tasty by over-priced range of organic food.  The natives are left free to fight each other in the Welsh Assembly.

Within this Romain-thwarting mountainous realm lies the village of Talybont-on-Usk, on whose metaphorical doorstep the spectacular Brecon Beacons may be found.  The village has much accomodation, a few pubs (one winning a CAMRA award), and a choice of water courses.

The village also has a hall, which we hope to book for 20-26th July this year.  The hall is good sized, well equipped, and looks out on to the nearby hills.

We have a website with a few links of interest on, http://lbw2014.þþ.be/

Cheers,
Dave
