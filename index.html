<h1>LBW 2014 proposal</h1>

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talybont-on-Usk">Talybont-on-Usk</a>, an agreeable village in Wales.
It has a CAMRA award winning pub, a canal, a river, and the Brecon Beacons National Park
almost on top of you.

<h2>We have a hall</h2>

<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
You will like it.  Largish, well equipment, even a proper kitchen.

<h2>We have dates</h2>

20-26th July 2014.  (There is another possibility of 10-17th August, but that is less
convienient for them.)

<h2>We don't have a web site</h2>

The two of us have urgent homework to complete!  More to come!
