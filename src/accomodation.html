<p>Talybont-on-Usk is a popular tourist destination, so while it has much accomodation,
it's also at risk of becoming booked up, especially if the weather looks like
it may be good this summer.  You want to book as early as you can.
<p>This year the hall won't be available to sleep in.

<h2>Have I left it too late?</h2>

<p>Hopefully not!  If you can't find anywhere to stay, get in touch and we shall do our
best to find somewhere for you.  Here are some tips.

<ul>
<li>Ask on the mailing list.  Details are on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</li>
<li>Ask at the <a href="http://tourism.powys.gov.uk/index.php?id=10">Brecon Tourist Information Centre</a>,
<a href="tel:+441874622485">+44 (0)1874 622485</a>.</li>
<li>Ask a couple who are staying in a cottage.  Some may have a spare room they can let you have.</li>
<li>Someone staying in a cottage may also have a spare sofa.</li>
<li>Try the Youth Hostel, they may not have a spare room, but they might have space in the bunk room.</li>
<li>Try the camp site at Pencelli, it's larger than the one in Talybont-on-Usk.  Once you're here, you may get a last minute cancellation somewhere higher class.</li>
<li>Try the White Hart bunk room.</li>
</ul>
