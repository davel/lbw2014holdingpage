<p>There are both
<a href="http://mountainhiking.org.uk/england-wales/brecon-beacons/index.shtml">walks</a>
at altitude for active days, and
<a href="http://www.breconbeaconsparksociety.org/walks/self-guided-walks/level-best-walks-without-hills/">walks</a>
along the river and
canal for more relaxed days.  There are also lots of
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/">less obvious things</a> including
<a href="http://www.cyclebreconbeacons.com/">cycling</a>,
<a href="http://www.canoewales.com/river-usk-brecon.aspx">canoeing</a> and
<a href="http://www.breconbeaconsparksociety.org/national-park/dark-skies/">stargazing</a>.

<p>In Talybont-on-Usk itself we are planning sessions on subjects ranging from
the starting fires to the Welsh language.  A tasting visit to a nearby pub
is also a possibility.
