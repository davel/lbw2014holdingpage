<h2>We have a hall</h2>

We have found a hall on the village on Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, the United
Kingdom.  The hall is
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
It is well equipped.  It is largish, has a kitchen, Internet connection, video
projector and useful things like that.  Interior pictures to come.

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>There are fields and a children's playground with swings and roundabouts
adjacent to the hall, owned by the
<a href="http://www.llanfrynach-community.org.uk/public_html/organisations-2/beacons-benefice/">parish council</a>. 
We can get in touch with them if we'd like to do anything organised on the
fields.

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talybont-on-Usk">Talybont-on-Usk</a>, an agreeable village in Wales.
It has a CAMRA award winning pub, a canal, a river, and the Brecon Beacons National Park
almost on top of you.

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>There are both walks at altitude for active days, and walks along the river and
canal for more relaxed days.  There are also lots of
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/">less obvious things</a> including
cycling, canoeing and stargazing.

<h2>Accomodation</h2>

<p><a href="http://talybontonusk.com/accommodation-3/">You can find a list of local accomodation here</a>.
If you wish to hire a cottage,
<a href="http://www.breconcottages.com/">Brecon Beacon Holiday Cottages</a> appear to run
the local monopoly.  To find cottages near Talybont-on-Usk on
<a href="http://www.breconcottages.com/map-search">this map</a>, zoom in on
Crickhowell, then Llangynidr. Talybont-on-Usk should then be visible.
(Other privately rented cottages may also be available.)

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049979">hall</a> can be found at
51.89742&deg;N, -3.29088&deg;E.  The OS grid reference is
<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/maps.html?mapsearch=SO1124622773&cat[0]=20">SO1124622773</a>.
The postcode is <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049979">LD3 7YQ</a>.

<p>The local website has a handy <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/getting-here/">travel guide</a>,
although parts of it may be out of date.

<p>The
<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" title="Ordnance Survey, not Open Source or Operating System">OS</a>
1:25,000 map covering Talybont-on-Usk is
<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-brecon-beacons-national-park-1383.html">OL13</a>.
We are fairly close to the border with
<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-brecon-beacons-national-park.html">OL12</a>,
so if you like buying maps you can justify two purchases.

<h3>By rail</h3>

<p>The nearest railway station closed many years ago.
The nearest useful railway station is at
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/AGV/details.html">Abergavenny</a>.
Note that the town also has a Welsh name, Y Fenni.  This should be a familiar
concept for Belgians.

<p>From Abergavenny, you can go &hellip;

<h3>By bus</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://planner.traveline-cymru.info/pdfs/timetables/PWBO043.pdf">43 / X43</a>
bus runs through Talybont-on-Usk.  It runs from Abergavenny (railway connection)
to Brecon.  <a href="http://www.traveline-cymru.info/">Traveline Cymru</a> provide
local bus information in Wales.  They cover various operating companies.

<p>The nearest <a href="http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/stop-finder">National Express coach stop</a>
is at Abergavenny.

<h3>By canal</h3>

<a href="http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/monmouthshire-and-brecon-canal">Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal</a>
runs through the Talybont-on-Usk.  Unfortunately the canal is not currently
connected to the rest of the network.  Boats can be hired.  It runs through
the towns of Abergavenny and Pontypool, both of which can be reached by railway.

<p>You could arrange your transport and accomodation in one swoop by hiring a
narrow boat at Abergavenny or Pontypool, and navigating it North to
Talybont-on-Usk.  (You will need to move it every couple of days, if I remember
the rules regarding mooring.)

<p>Boats also also available
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/day-boat-hire/">locally for day hire</a>.

The <a href="http://www.wyeuskfoundation.org/navigation/index.php">River Usk</a>

<p>Point your sat-nav at the postcode <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049979">LD3 7YQ</a>.
There is parking at the hall.

<p>There are lots of twisty
narrow roads in this area, a right-hand drive car may be preferable.
(Or a motorbike!)

<p>There is local car rental, including an <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/hiring-an-electric-car/">electric car</a>.

Note that with all the hills and mountains around, forecasts may not be as
reliable as you might wish.

<h2>We yet don't have a proper web site</h2>

The two of us have urgent homework to complete!  More to come!  Until then,
please look at the <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/">local web site</a>.
