<h2>We have a hall</h2>

<p>We have found a hall on the village on Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, the United
Kingdom.  The hall is
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
It is well equipped.  It is largish, has a kitchen,
<a href="http://pic.twitter.com/eXHCvkrNtf">Internet connection</a>, video
projector and useful things like that.  Interior pictures to come.

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>There are fields and a children's playground with swings and roundabouts
adjacent to the hall, owned by the
<a href="http://www.llanfrynach-community.org.uk/public_html/organisations-2/beacons-benefice/">parish council</a>. 
We can get in touch with them if we'd like to do anything organised on the
fields.

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talybont-on-Usk">Talybont-on-Usk</a>, an agreeable village in Wales.
It has a
<a href="http://swanseacamra.org.uk/2014/03/25/south-wales-area-pub-of-the-year-winners-revealed/">CAMRA award winning pub</a>,
a canal, a river, and the
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/">Brecon Beacons National Park</a>
almost on top of you. The village is also called <span lang="cy">Tal-y-bont ar Wysg</span> in Welsh.

<p>There is a free (for UK debit cards) cash machine at the post office.
Post Office (<span lang="cy">Swyddfa'r Post Cyf</span>)
opening hours are Monday to Saturday, 09:00 to 13:00.  There is

<h3>Pubs</h3>

<p>Talybont-on-Usk has four pubs,
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.starinntalybont.co.uk/">The Star Inn</a>, where we had an agreeable meal while scouting.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.breconbunkhouse.co.uk/">The White Hart Inn</a>, which has
an attached four-star bunk house.  I don't really understand how stars ratings
can apply to a bunk house, but I'm sure it can't be a bad thing.
</li>
</ul>

We are fairly close to the border with

<h3>By rail</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21128-former-talybont-railway-station-talybont-">nearest railway station</a>
closed many years ago.
The nearest useful railway station is at
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/AGV/details.html">Abergavenny</a>.
Note that the town also has a Welsh name, Y Fenni.  This should be a familiar
concept for Belgians.
The next closest railway station, which may or may not have better connections is
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/MER/details.html">Merthyr Tydfil</a>
<p>From Abergavenny, you can go &hellip;

<h3>By bus</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://planner.traveline-cymru.info/pdfs/timetables/PWBO043.pdf">43 / X43</a>
bus runs through Talybont-on-Usk.  It runs from Abergavenny (railway connection)
to Brecon.  <a href="http://www.traveline-cymru.info/">Traveline Cymru</a> provide
local bus information in Wales.  They cover various operating companies.
To travel by bus from Merthyr Tydfil you need to change at Brecon.

<p>The nearest <a href="http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/stop-finder">National Express coach stop</a>
is at Abergavenny.

<h3>By canal</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/monmouthshire-and-brecon-canal">Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal</a>
runs through the Talybont-on-Usk.  Unfortunately the canal is not currently
connected to the rest of the network.  Boats can be hired.  It runs through
the towns of Abergavenny and Pontypool, both of which can be reached by railway.

<p>You could arrange your transport and accomodation in one swoop by hiring a
narrow boat at Abergavenny or Pontypool, and navigating it North to
Talybont-on-Usk.  (You will need to move it every couple of days, if I remember
the rules regarding mooring.)

<p>Boats also also available
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/day-boat-hire/">locally for day hire</a>.

<h3>By river</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wyeuskfoundation.org/navigation/index.php">River Usk</a>

<p>Point your sat-nav at the postcode <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049979">LD3 7YQ</a>.

narrow roads in this area, a right-hand drive car may be preferable.
