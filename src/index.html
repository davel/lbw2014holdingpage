<h1>LBW 2014, Talybont-on-Usk</h1>

<p>The 2014 <a href="http://www.linuxbierwanderung.com/" title="Linux Bier Wanderung">LBW</a> is planned for <strong>20th&ndash;26th July 2014</strong> in
the village of <strong>Talybont-on-Usk</strong>, Wales.

<h2>What is the LBW?</h2>

<p>LBW is a week-long event which takes place in a different European country
each summer, drawing together Open Source software enthusiasts from more than
a dozen different countries, for a combination of talks, presentations,
hands-on mini-projects, outdoor exercise, and good food and drink.

<p><a href="http://www.linuxbierwanderung.com/">There is more information here</a>.

<h2>We have a hall</h2>

We have found a hall on the village on Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, the United
Kingdom.  The hall is
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
It is well equipped.  It is largish, has a kitchen, Internet connection, video
projector and useful things like that.  Interior pictures to come.

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talybont-on-Usk">Talybont-on-Usk</a>, an agreeable village in Wales.
It has a CAMRA award winning pub, a canal, a river, and the Brecon Beacons National Park
almost on top of you.

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>There are both walks at altitude for active days, and walks along the river and
canal for more relaxed days.  There are also lots of
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/">less obvious things</a> including
cycling, canoeing and stargazing.

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>The local website has a handy <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/getting-here/">travel guide</a>.

<h3>By rail</h3>

<p>The nearest railway station closed many years ago.
The nearest useful railway station is at
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/AGV/details.html">Abergavenny</a>.
Note that the town also has a Welsh name, Y Fenni.  This should be a familiar
concept for Belgians.

<p>From Abergavenny, you can go &hellip;

<h3>By bus</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://planner.traveline-cymru.info/pdfs/timetables/PWBO043.pdf">43 / X43</a>
bus runs through Talybont-on-Usk.  It runs from Abergavenny (railway connection)
to Brecon.  <a href="http://www.traveline-cymru.info/">Traveline Cymru</a> provide
local bus information in Wales.  They cover various operating companies.

<p>The nearest <a href="http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/stop-finder">National Express coach stop</a>
is at Abergavenny.

<h3>By canal</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/monmouthshire-and-brecon-canal">Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal</a>
runs through the Talybont-on-Usk.  Unfortunately the canal is not currently
connected to the rest of the network.  Boats can be hired.  It runs through
the towns of Abergavenny and Pontypool, both of which can be reached by railway.

<p>You could arrange your transport and accomodation in one swoop by hiring a
narrow boat at Abergavenny or Pontypool, and navigating it North to
Talybont-on-Usk.  (You will need to move it every couple of days, if I remember
the rules regarding mooring.)

<p>Boats also also available
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/day-boat-hire/">localliy for day hire</a>.

<h3>By river</h3>

The <a href="http://www.wyeuskfoundation.org/navigation/index.php">River Usk</a>
may be navigable as far as Talybont-on-Usk.  Can anybody clarify?

<h3>By car</h3>

<p>Point your sat-nav at the postcode <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/note/134361">LD3 7YQ</a>.
There is parking at the hall.

<p>There are lots of twisty
narrow roads in this area, a right-hand drive car may be preferable.
(Or a motorbike!)

<p>There is local car rental, including an <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/hiring-an-electric-car/">electric car</a>.
