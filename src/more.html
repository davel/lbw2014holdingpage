<h2>We have a hall</h2>

<p>We have found a hall on the village on Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, the United
Kingdom.  The hall is
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
It is well equipped.  It is largish, has a kitchen,
<a href="http://pic.twitter.com/eXHCvkrNtf">Internet connection</a>, video
projector and useful things like that.  Interior pictures to come.

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>There are fields and a children's playground with swings and roundabouts
adjacent to the hall, owned by the
<a href="http://www.llanfrynach-community.org.uk/public_html/organisations-2/beacons-benefice/">parish council</a>. 
We can get in touch with them if we'd like to do anything organised on the
fields.

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talybont-on-Usk">Talybont-on-Usk</a>, an agreeable village in Wales.
It has a

<a href="http://swanseacamra.org.uk/2014/03/25/south-wales-area-pub-of-the-year-winners-revealed/" title="The Star Inn, winning a CAMRA award">award winning pub</a>,
a canal, a river, and the
<a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/">Brecon Beacons National Park</a>
almost on top of you. The village is also called <span lang="cy">Tal-y-bont ar Wysg</span> in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learning/learnwelsh/">Welsh</a>.

<p>There is a free (for UK debit cards) cash machine at the post office.

<h3>Pubs</h3>

<p>Talybont-on-Usk has four pubs, all
<a href="http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/de/map/unbenannte-karte_8654#17/51.89504/-3.28616" title="Pubs in Talybont-on-Usk">marked on this map</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.starinntalybont.co.uk/">The Star Inn</a>, where we had an agreeable meal while scouting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.uskinn.co.uk/">The Usk Inn</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.travellersrestinn.com/">The Travellers</a>.  It's unclear if this is
actually a pub.  It may be merely an ambitious restaurant that requires booking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.breconbunkhouse.co.uk/">The White Hart Inn</a>, which has
an attached four-star bunk house.  I don't really understand how stars ratings
can apply to a bunk house, but I'm sure it can't be a bad thing.
</li>
</ul>

Other good pubs are a pleasant walk away,

<li>A couple of kilometres down the road is

may be found.  Beer garden, good food, etc.  This pub is particularly recommended by us should there
be a power cut following a storm.</li>
