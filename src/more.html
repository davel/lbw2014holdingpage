<h2>We have a hall</h2>

<p>We have booked a hall in Talybont-on-Usk,
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/community-hall/corporate-bookings/">Henderson Hall</a>.
The hall is a flexible space, with a concertina divider across the middle,
and between the hall and adjacent meeting room to which we also have access.
There is even a stage!

<p>There is a kitchen adjacent to the meeting room.  It has two kettles and
a water boiler, so we will be well supplied for tea.  There is a dishwasher, so
no excuse for leaving unwashed crockery!  We are able to use the kitchen for
making hot drinks all week.  We have negotiated to use it for cooking proper on
one day for <abbr title="Communal cooking evening">pot-luck</abbr>, and also
to support are barbecue on Friday.

<p>The kitchen may also be used for cooking your evening meal provided you
donate &pound;5 per person per day.

<p>Technology wise, we have a 6Mbs<sup>-1</sup>
<a href="http://pic.twitter.com/eXHCvkrNtf">Internet connection</a>, data
projector with screen, stereo sound system.  A DVD player is set up ready to use.

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049980">fields</a>
and a <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049977">children's playground with swings and roundabouts</a>
adjacent to the hall, owned by the Talybont on Usk parish council.

fields.

<h2>We have a village</h2>

<li><a href="http://www.travellersrestinn.com/">The Travellers</a>.  It's unclear if this is
actually a pub.  It may be merely an ambitious restaurant that requires booking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.breconbunkhouse.co.uk/">The White Hart Inn</a>, which has
an attached four-star bunk house.  I don't really understand how stars ratings
can apply to a bunk house, but I'm sure it can't be a bad thing.
Scouting found a wide selections of ales and ciders, including those from
<a href="http://www.rhymneybreweryltd.com/">Rhymney</a>,
<a href="http://www.felinfoel-brewery.com/">Felinfoel</a>,
