<p>Please order your t-shirts!  The deadline has not yet been confirmed, so
please get your order in as soon as possible if you would like one.  To order one please email
<a href="mailto:lbw2014@xn--vdaa.be">lbw2014@xn--vdaa.be</a> with your
name and the sizes you would like.

<p>T-shirts will cost &pound;14.50, and will made of an olive coloured
lightweight fabric (possibly organic, apologies to fans of ionic compounds).
The front design will be of the dragon, below, and the back print will be the
list of previous dates, as is tradition.

<p>Womens' fit shirts will also hopefully be available, in hopefully a similar design
to the mens'.
