We are fairly close to the border with

so if you like buying maps you can justify two purchases.

<h2>By rail</h2>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21128-former-talybont-railway-station-talybont-">nearest railway station</a>
closed many years ago.
The nearest useful railway station is at
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/AGV/details.html">Abergavenny</a>.
Note that the town also has a Welsh name, Y Fenni.  This should be a familiar
concept for Belgians.
The next closest railway station, which may or may not have better connections is
<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/MER/details.html">Merthyr Tydfil</a>
<p>From Abergavenny, you can go &hellip;

<h2>By bus</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://planner.traveline-cymru.info/pdfs/timetables/PWBO043.pdf">43 / X43</a>
bus runs through Talybont-on-Usk.  It runs from Abergavenny (railway connection)
to Brecon.  <a href="http://www.traveline-cymru.info/">Traveline Cymru</a> provide
local bus information in Wales.  They cover various operating companies.
To travel by bus from Merthyr Tydfil you need to change at Brecon.


<p>The last bus to Talybont-on-Usk from Abergavenny (or indeed anywhere) is
unhelpfully earlier (17:50).  A later, but not much later, bus stops at
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/981540472" title="Bwlch, pronounced &lsquo;boolch&rsquo;">Bwlch</a>.
There is a minicab service there, <a href="http://www.yell.com/biz/dee-s-taxis-brecon-4006028/">Dee's Taxis</a>
on <a href"tel:+441874731012">01874 731012</a>.
At this point a <a href="http://www.bicycle-beano.co.uk/extra/welsh.html">Welsh place name pronounciation guide</a>
may be helpful.

<p>The nearest <a href="http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/stop-finder">National Express coach stop</a>
is at Abergavenny.

<h2>By taxi</h2>

<p>Abergavenny is well served by <a href="http://www.yell.com/ucs/UcsSearchAction.do?keywords=TAXIS+%26+PRIVATE+HIRE+VEHICLES&location=abergavenny+station">taxis and minicabs</a>.

<h2>By canal</h2>

<p>The
<a href="http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/monmouthshire-and-brecon-canal">Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal</a>
runs through the Talybont-on-Usk.  Unfortunately the canal is not currently
connected to the rest of the network.  Boats can be hired.  It runs through
the towns of Abergavenny and Pontypool, both of which can be reached by railway.

<p>You could arrange your transport and accomodation in one swoop by hiring a
narrow boat at Abergavenny or Pontypool, and navigating it North to
Talybont-on-Usk.  (You will need to move it every couple of days, if I remember
the rules regarding mooring.)

<p>Boats also also available
<a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/day-boat-hire/">locally for day hire</a>.

<h2>By river</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wyeuskfoundation.org/navigation/index.php">River Usk</a>
may be navigable as far as Talybont-on-Usk.  Can anybody clarify?

<h2>By car</h2>

<p>Point your sat-nav at the postcode <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/266049979">LD3 7YQ</a>.
There is parking at the hall.

<p>There are lots of twisty
narrow roads in this area, a right-hand drive car may be preferable.
(Or a
<a href="http://www.bestbikingroads.com/motorcycle-roads/motorbike-rides-in-united-kingdom-/south-east-wales-___536.html">motorbike</a>!)

<p>There is local car rental, including an <a href="http://talybontonusk.com/things-to-do/hiring-an-electric-car/">electric car</a>.
